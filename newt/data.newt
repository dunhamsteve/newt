module Data

-- The code to handle this is full of TODO
-- stuff is not checked and it's not read as data, just
-- type signatures.

data Nat : U where
  Z : Nat
  S : Nat -> Nat

-- My initial version of this needed unbound implicits
data Maybe : U -> U where
  Nothing : {a : U} -> Maybe a
  Just : {a : U} -> a -> Maybe a
