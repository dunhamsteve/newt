# Newt

Newt is a dependently typed programming language that compiles to javascript. It is
my first attempt to write a dependent typed language. It is inspired by Idris,
Elaboration Zoo, pi-forall, and various tutorials.

I'm still learning how this stuff is done, so it's a bit of a mess. But I'm going to
work with the garage door up.

The goal is to have inductive types, pattern matching, compile to javascript, and be
self hosted. Ideally I could build a little browser "playground" to compile, view
output, and run code.

## Building

There is a `Makefile` that builds both chez and javascript versions.  They end up in
`build/exec` as usual.  I've also added a `pack.toml`, so `pack build`

There is a vscode extension in `newt-vscode`. Running `make vscode` will build and install it. The extension expects `build/exec/newt` to exist in the workspace.

## Overview

I'm doing Type in Type for now.

The type checking and implicits are based on elaboration zoo. I'm using normalization
by evaluation with closure objects rather than HOAS.  When going under binders in the
typechecking, I follow Kov√°cs example and place a `VVar` into the environment instead of
doing `subst`.

The raw syntax is `Raw`. This is elaborated to `Tm`. There is a top level context and a
context during checking. The top level context uses names, and type checking uses deBruijn
indices for `Tm` and levels for `Val`.  For compilation, this is converted to `CExp`, which works out how arity and closures will work, and then `JSExp` which is javascript AST.

I have `Let` in the core language. Partly because I'd like this to make it into javascript (only compute once), but also because it's being leveraged by the casetree stuff.

## Case Tree

I've got no idea what I'm doing here. I worked off of Jesper Cockx "Elaborating Dependent (Co)pattern Matching", leaving out codata for now.

For the dependent thing, I've change unify to return `VVar` constraints. I think such constraints would be an error while typechecking on RHS (meta solutions are handled separately). On the LHS, I'm rewriting the environment to turn the var from a bind to a define. Unification has been tweaked to look up `VVar` in environment. Bind will hand back the same `VVar`.

Some of this I could probably do with subst, but the RHS is `Raw`, it takes typechecking to turn it into a clean `Tm`, and I need this information for the typechecking.  To substitute into the goal type for the RHS, I am now
doing a quote and eval to get case to expand. This is a bit of a stopgap because case is only eval'd when going
from `Tm` to `Val`. I think I'll need a way to eval a VCase during unification, as we do with function applications.

## Evaluation

Following kovacs, I'm putting `VVar` into context env when I go under binders. This avoids substitution.

## Issues

- I should do some erasure of values unused at runtime
- I'm a little fuzzy on the "right way" to deal with constraints from unification
- I'm a little fuzzy on how much to evaluate and when
- I'm not postponing anything, and I suspect I will need to

"Elaborating Dependent (Co)pattern Matching" describes building case trees. Section 5.2 has the algorithm.

"A prettier printer" was the basis of the pretty printer.

"Elaboration Zoo" was a resource for typechecking and elaboration. In particular pattern unification and handling of implicits is based on that.

"Unifiers as Equivalences" has unification with types.  Look into adapting some of that (or at least read/understand it).  Indexed types are mentioned here.
