Parser is in place. 

Currently trying to make TT well-scoped, considering well-named..

Need to update todos below.
Should I use well-scoped indices or well-scoped names...

Parser:
- [x] import statement
- [x] def
- [x] simple decl
- [ ] type definition
- [x] read files

- [ ] type checking / elab
- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] symbolic execution
- [ ] compilation

- [ ] write tests
